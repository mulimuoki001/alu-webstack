A web stack, also known as a software stack or technology stack, refers to a collection of software technologies and tools that are used together to build and run web applications. It typically consists of four main components:

Client-side: This includes the technologies used on the user's browser or client-side, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Server-side: This includes the technologies used on the server to handle requests and generate responses, such as programming languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Node.js) and frameworks (e.g., Django, Ruby on Rails, Express.js).

Database: This includes the technologies used to store and retrieve data, such as relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).

Operating System and Server: This includes the underlying operating system and the web server software that hosts and serves the web application.

The specific technologies and tools used in a web stack can vary depending on the requirements of the application and the preferences of the development team.
