A firewall is a network security device that acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet. It monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Its main purpose is to protect the internal network from unauthorized access and potential threats by filtering the network traffic and only allowing authorized connections. Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software forms.
