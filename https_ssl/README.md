HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol used for transmitting data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS ensures that the communication between the browser and the website is encrypted and secure.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the predecessor of Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is the protocol used to establish a secure connection between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., a website). SSL and TLS provide encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure the data transmitted over the internet.

In the context of HTTPS, SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish a secure connection between the client and the server. These certificates are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and contain cryptographic keys that are used to encrypt and decrypt the data. When a website has an SSL/TLS certificate installed, the browser and the server can establish a secure connection using HTTPS, ensuring that the data transmitted between them is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping and tampering.

HTTPS and SSL/TLS are essential for securing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card details, and other personal data, transmitted over the internet. They provide a layer of security that helps protect users' privacy and prevent unauthorized access to their data.
